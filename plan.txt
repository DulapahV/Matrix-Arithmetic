Program Detail:
1. Support 
    - Addition (Done)
    - Subtraction (Done)
    - Multiplication (including multiplication of integer and matrixes) (Done)
    - Determinant (Working on it)
    - Transposition (Done)
    - Inverse (Planning)
    - Adjoint (Planning)

    * Also detects matrixes compatibility when performing operation

2. Answer are automatically stored in 'Matrix Answer' so that it can be used to compute or perform further operation later on

3. User can view each stored matrix value (max stored matrix is 7)

4. Selected matrix and answer are automatically output in the 'output.txt' with proper formatting (Planning)

5. User has an option to clear selected/all matrix value (Planning)
